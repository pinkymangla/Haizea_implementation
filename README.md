Haizea implementation for deadline sensitive leases (Cloud Computing)

As we know Haizea is an open-source virtual machine based lease management software. It allows user to send request in the form of leases. It supports different types of leases from which deadline sensitive lease is one of them. In real time, most of the leases are deadline sensitive leases. 
I have implemented it in C++.
